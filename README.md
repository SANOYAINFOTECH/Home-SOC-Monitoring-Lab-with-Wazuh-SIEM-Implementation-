# 🖥️ Home SOC Monitoring Lab with Wazuh (SIEM Implementation)  

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **home SOC monitoring environment** using the **Wazuh SIEM platform**.  
The goal is to configure a Wazuh Manager, connect multiple agents, and visualize security alerts in the dashboard.

As a SOC analyst, this project helped me understand **real-time monitoring**, **alert correlation**, and **log analysis** — the foundation of modern SOC operations.
